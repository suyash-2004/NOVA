#Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to clone the VoxIQ repository, navigate to the project directory, and install the required dependencies:

1. **Clone the VoxIQ Repository**: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the VoxIQ repository from GitHub. This will download the project files to your computer.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/voxiq.git
    ```

    Replace `https://github.com/your-username/voxiq.git` with the actual URL of your VoxIQ repository on GitHub.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you have the VoxIQ project files. For example:

    ```bash
    cd voxiq
    ```

    This assumes that you have a directory named `voxiq` that contains the project files.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This command tells pip to read the `requirements.txt` file and install all the specified packages and their required versions.

4. **Wait for Installation**: pip will download and install the listed packages and their dependencies. It may take a moment, depending on the number and size of the packages.

5. **Installation Complete**: Once the installation is complete, you'll see a confirmation message indicating that the packages have been successfully installed.

Now, your system is set up with all the necessary dependencies, and you have the VoxIQ project files ready to use. You can proceed to use the virtual assistant as described in the project's documentation.

Make sure to replace `https://github.com/your-username/voxiq.git` with the actual URL of your VoxIQ repository on GitHub.
